## Summary of Locomotive Changes

Standard locomotives remain the same.  They have higher speeds in some conditions, but take a long time to get up to speed. 
Some of the numbers reflect effective max speed and real max speed; depending on the length of rail it may not reach the specified speed.

Hybrid and Nuclear locomotives, increased acceleration, so they get up to higher speeds faster at a slight increase in power requirement.

Junk train locomotive had to have lowered air resistance so it could approach the same speeds on junk rails.
